# Online Retail Cohort Retention Analysis

## Overview
This project performs an end-to-end cohort retention analysis on an e-commerce transactions dataset.
The goal is to understand customer retention behavior over time and identify patterns in repeat purchasing.

The analysis covers data cleaning, KPI calculation, cohort construction, and interactive visualization using Power BI.

---

## Dataset
The project uses the **Online Retail Dataset**, which contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer.

**Key fields include:**
- InvoiceNo
- StockCode
- Quantity
- InvoiceDate
- UnitPrice
- CustomerID
- Country

The raw dataset includes cancellations and incomplete records, which are handled during the data cleaning stage.

Analysis Workflow
1. Data Cleaning

Removed cancelled transactions

Dropped records with missing CustomerID

Filtered out non-positive quantities and prices

Created a Revenue field (Quantity × UnitPrice)

2. Business KPIs

Total Revenue

Number of Unique Customers

Average Revenue per Customer

Revenue distribution across customers

3. Cohort Analysis

Customers are grouped into cohorts based on their first purchase month

A CohortIndex is calculated to track customer activity over time

Retention rates are computed for each cohort

4. Data Storage

A SQLite database (retail.db) is created locally from the cleaned dataset

The database is excluded from version control due to size constraints and can be regenerated by running the notebook

Visualization (Power BI)

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize:

Cohort retention matrix (heatmap)

Retention trends over time

These visuals allow easy exploration of customer retention patterns across cohorts.

Key Insights

Customer retention drops significantly after the first month

Early cohorts show stronger long-term retention compared to later ones

Only a small percentage of customers remain active after several months

Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, numpy)

SQLite

SQL

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

How to Reproduce

Clone the repository

Place the raw dataset in data/raw/

Run analysis.ipynb to generate processed data and the SQLite database

Open the Power BI dashboard (.pbix) for visualization

Notes

The SQLite database (retail.db) is generated locally and is not included in the repository due to its size.
